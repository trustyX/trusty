# trusty

This system developed here aspires to encourage trust between parents and their children by providing a shared app ("trusty") that uses machine learning to determine if the content posted or viewed by a member of the group exceeds the 'trust threshold' that the rest of the group has established for that member.

Example use case:
* a 14 year old girl is engaging in a Snapchat exchange with a contact she has never met. She receives and views content that asks her to meet the contact in a physical location. This is flagged by trusty as needing parental review and both the parent and daughter are informed of it. If the system misidentifies the trust required to not flag this content the parent labels it as such and the system adjusts.
