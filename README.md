# Trusty - "Don't track, trust."

This system developed here aspires to encourage trust between parents and their children by providing a shared app ("trusty") that uses machine learning to determine if the content posted or viewed by a member of the group or other action taken exceeds the 'trust threshold' that the rest of the group has established for that member.

Example use cases:
* a 14 year old girl is engaging in a Snapchat exchange with a contact she has never met. She receives and views content that asks her to meet the contact in a physical location. This is flagged by trusty as needing parental review and both the parent and daughter are informed of it. If the system misidentifies the trust required to not flag this content the parent labels it as such and the system adjusts.
* a 16 year old boy who just got his license exceeds the speed limit by 15 mph

Unlike other teen monitoring systems, it makes the notifications sent among the group transparent to encourage trust rather than discourage it. It also monitors text messages and content viewing, not just actions. It keeps everything from being seen so the teen retains privacy for personal but unconcerning activity. As the child grows the parent can adjust a 'trust threshold' to see more or less content as needed.
